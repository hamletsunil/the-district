# The District: Art Direction

**Companion to DESIGN_SYSTEM.md. This governs the visual and illustrative language.**

---

## I. VISUAL IDENTITY

### Brand Personality
<!-- What feeling should the art convey? Authoritative? Approachable? Serious? Playful? -->

### References & Inspirations
<!-- Publications, artists, or styles that inform the look. Examples: The Economist's illustrated covers, ProPublica's data viz, etc. -->

---

## II. ILLUSTRATION STYLE

### Current Types
The homepage defines four illustration categories:
- `data-centers` — infrastructure, tech, servers
- `housing` — residential, development, buildings
- `zoning` — maps, boundaries, land use
- `climate` — environment, energy, sustainability

### Style Guidelines
<!--
Describe the illustration approach:
- Line weight and quality
- Color palette usage
- Level of abstraction vs. realism
- Recurring motifs or symbols
- What to avoid (photorealism? clip art? gradients?)
-->

### Format & Specs
<!-- Dimensions, file types, resolution requirements for different contexts (hero, card, social) -->

---

## III. HERO IMAGERY

### Purpose
<!-- What role does the hero serve? Mood-setting? Literal representation? Abstract? -->

### Composition Guidelines
<!-- Where does text sit? Safe zones? Parallax considerations? -->

### Per-Theme Considerations
| Theme | Color World | Imagery Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| `data-center` | Navy/blue | |
| `abundance` | Cream/green | |
| `vote-tracker` | Slate/indigo | |
| `temperature` | Brown/red | |

## IV. DATA VISUALIZATION

### Chart Aesthetics
<!-- Beyond the functional patterns in DESIGN_SYSTEM.md — what's the visual style? Clean and minimal? Annotated and editorial? -->

### When to Use Custom Illustrations vs. Charts
<!-- Guidelines for choosing between data viz and illustrated graphics -->

---

## V. PHOTOGRAPHY (if applicable)

### Usage
<!-- Is photography used? Stock? Original? When is illustration preferred over photography? -->

### Treatment
<!-- Filters, overlays, cropping approach -->

---

## VI. ICONS & SYMBOLS

### Style
<!-- Line icons? Filled? Consistent stroke weight? -->

### Usage Contexts
<!-- Navigation, inline, decorative -->

---

## VII. DO NOT

<!--
Explicit anti-patterns. Examples:
- No stock photo clichés (handshakes, people pointing at screens)
- No clip art
- No unlicensed imagery
- No AI-generated art without review
-->
