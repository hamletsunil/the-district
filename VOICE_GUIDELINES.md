# The District: Voice & Style Constitution

**Companion to EDITORIAL_STANDARDS.md (Data Integrity). This governs HOW we write.**

---

## I. THE ECONOMIST PRINCIPLES

The District writes like The Economist: **confident, concise, slightly wry**. Never breathless. Never corporate. Never hedging.

### Be Declarative
Say what is. Don't suggest, imply, or raise questions.

| AI-Sounding | Economist-Style |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "This raises questions about..." | "The data reveals a gap." |
| "It suggests that cities may be..." | "Cities are divided." |
| "What we found was surprising." | State the finding. Let readers decide if it's surprising. |

### Be Brief
If a sentence adds no information, delete it.

| Filler | Direct |
|--------|--------|
| "In an era defined by..." | Cut entirely. Start with the fact. |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just note it. |
| "This is democracy in action." | Cut. Editorializing. |

### Be Specific
Generic language signals nothing. Specific language signals reporting.

| Generic | Specific |
|---------|----------|
| "echoes across America" | "appeared in 14 other cities' minutes" |
| "a pattern emerges" | "Newark officials voted yes 119 times" |
| "infrastructure strain" | "the grid operator projected a 240MW shortfall" |

## II. THE KILL LIST

**Never use these phrases. They are AI tells.**

### Banned Sentence Starters
- "These aren't just..."
- "This isn't just..."
- "What we found:"
- "The data reveals..."
- "In an era of..."
- "For the first time..."
- "It's worth noting..."
- "Interestingly,"
- "Notably,"
- "Perhaps unsurprisingly,"

### Banned Framing Devices
- "raises questions about"
- "suggests that"
- "may be" / "might be" (when you can say "is")
- "emerges as"
- "echoes across"
- "reshaping" / "reshape"
- "the era of X"
- "democracy in action"
- "a story of"
- "the bottom line:"

### Banned Stakeholder Language
Never segment readers like a marketing deck:
- "For developers, this means..."
- "For residents, the implication is..."
- "For activists, the data offers..."

Just state the implication. Readers will apply it themselves.

### Banned Intensifiers
- "fundamentally" (unless discussing foundations)
- "striking" / "strikingly"
- "sobering"
- "robust" (unless describing statistics)
- "actionable" (corporate jargon)

## III. STRUCTURAL RULES

### No Template Sentences
If a sentence could appear unchanged in a different article, rewrite it.

**Test:** Can this sentence work in an article about housing, data centers, AND voting records? If yes, it's too generic.

### Vary Your Openings
Each article's lede should feel distinct. No formula.

| Formula (every article) | Varied |
|-------------------------|--------|
| "In [City], [official] asked..." | Try: a number, a quote, a contradiction, a scene |
| "We analyzed X [things] across Y [places]" | Delay the methodology. Lead with the finding. |

### Kill Parallel Structure Abuse
AI loves triads. Humans are messier.

| Mechanical | Natural |
|------------|---------|
| "Some cities approve. Some resist. Some wait." | "Most approve quietly. A handful fight." |
| "For jobs. For growth. For the future." | Rewrite entirely. |

## IV. VOICE CALIBRATION

### Confidence Without Arrogance
The Economist states facts as facts. It doesn't hedge constantly—but it also doesn't pretend certainty where none exists.

- GOOD: "Chandler residents opposed the facility."
- BAD: "Chandler residents seem to have opposed the facility."
- GOOD: "The data doesn't show whether opposition will succeed." (honest uncertainty)
- BAD: "This may or may not indicate future trends." (meaningless hedge)

### Wit, Not Cleverness
The Economist earns its wry observations through understatement.

- GOOD: "The 12-minute approval suggests Temple is not deliberating heavily."
- BAD: "Temple clearly isn't sweating the details!" (too casual)
- BAD: "This represents a paradigm shift in municipal deliberation." (too corporate)

### Distance, Not Detachment
We're observers, not cheerleaders—but we're not robots either.

- GOOD: "The debate lasted three meetings—unusual for a routine zoning matter."
- BAD: "The passionate community engagement showcased vibrant local democracy."

## V. QUOTE HANDLING

### Quotes Should Add, Not Decorate
If a quote says what the surrounding prose says, cut one.

| Decorative | Additive |
|------------|----------|
| "Residents were concerned. 'I'm concerned,' said one resident." | Cut the quote or cut the setup. |
| (Using a quote as evidence for a claim it doesn't support) | Quote must directly validate the specific claim. |

### Attribution Standards
- First reference: full name + role ("Council member Mark Freda")
- After: last name only ("Freda voted no")
- Never: "a resident noted" (who?)

### No Quote Sandwiches
Don't bury quotes between identical paraphrases.

---

## VI. THE ATLANTIC PRINCIPLE: EARN YOUR CLAIMS

The Atlantic makes arguments. It doesn't just present data and hope readers connect dots.

### State Your Interpretation
If the data implies something, say so. Then defend it.

- GOOD: "Newark's unanimous votes point to a council that aligns before the public meeting—or one where dissent is discouraged."
- BAD: "Newark's unanimous votes raise questions." (about what? say it)

### Acknowledge Counter-Arguments
Then address them. Don't leave them floating.

- GOOD: "One explanation: Newark simply receives well-prepared proposals. But the absence of any dissent—on any issue—makes this hard to credit."

## VII. SELF-EDIT CHECKLIST

Before publishing, read aloud and ask:

- [ ] Could a journalist at The Economist have written this sentence?
- [ ] Does every sentence add information? (Cut filler ruthlessly)
- [ ] Did I use any Kill List phrases? (Search and destroy)
- [ ] Did I segment readers like a marketing deck?
- [ ] Does the lede sound like the other articles' ledes?
- [ ] Am I hedging because I'm uncertain, or because I'm lazy?
- [ ] Could this quote be cut without losing anything?
- [ ] Did I make an argument, or just present data?

## VIII. EXAMPLES: BEFORE/AFTER

### Example 1: AI-Sounding to Human
**Before:**
> "What we found was striking. These aren't just numbers—they're a window into how local democracy functions. For developers, the data offers actionable intelligence. For residents, it raises questions about accountability."

**After:**
> "Most council votes are unanimous. This tells us something about when real decisions happen: not at the public meeting."

### Example 2: Hedging to Declarative
**Before:**
> "The concentration of no-voters in Princeton may suggest that the borough's development politics differ systematically from other municipalities."

**After:**
> "Princeton has five officials who vote no more than yes—unusual enough to notice."

### Example 3: Template to Specific
**Before:**
> "In an era of increasing scrutiny over data center development, communities across America are grappling with difficult questions."

**After:**
> "Chandler's council spent three meetings on a single data center. Most cities spend ten minutes."

## IX. INVESTIGATIVE DEPTH

Data journalism without investigation is a spreadsheet. Every article must dig deep.

### Article Length Requirement
**Minimum 500-700 words per article.** Every article must have enough space to:
- Present the finding
- Explain why it matters
- Explore the cause
- Consider alternatives
- Connect to external reporting

### The Five Whys
For every significant data point, ask "why" five layers deep:

**Example: Newark council unanimity**
1. WHY does Newark vote unanimously? → Officials always agree
2. WHY do they always agree? → Either pre-meeting alignment or groupthink
3. WHY would there be pre-meeting alignment? → Party caucuses, staff preparation, consensus culture
4. WHY would a city have strong consensus culture? → One-party dominance, professional staff, low-stakes agenda items
5. WHY would this matter to readers? → Either good governance or captured process—research determines which

Each "why" demands external research, not speculation.

### External Research Requirement
**Every article must include at least 2-3 external sources** that:
- Validate or contextualize the data pattern found
- Provide possible explanations for the pattern
- Connect the local finding to broader trends or scholarship

Sources must be:
- Local news reporting on the specific cities/issues
- Academic research on the phenomenon
- Government reports or official statements

### Alternative Explanations Requirement
**Never present a single interpretation.** For every pattern:

| Pattern Found | Suspicious Read | Benign Read |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 100% approval rate | Rubber-stamping | Well-prepared agenda, professional staff |
| 0% approval rate | Obstructionist, NIMBY | Principled opposition, representing constituents |
| Low environmental approval | Anti-environment | Contentious projects, genuine policy debate |

Present both. Let research (and the reader) determine which is more credible.

### The Investigation Checklist
Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Did I ask "why" at least 5 times for the main finding?
- [ ] Did I search for external sources explaining this pattern?
- [ ] Did I present at least 2 possible explanations?
- [ ] Did I identify what additional reporting would determine the truth?
- [ ] Is the article 500+ words of actual narrative (not data tables)?
